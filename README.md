# solid-barnacle
Step file automation for gherkin feature files for Python's behave BDD framework.

## About
solid-barnacle is a tool to auto-generate scenario files from gherkin DSL files. Although this tool
is specifically designed for Python's behave, the formatters can extend to other step file stubs like jBehave.

solid-barnacle can update the required step files when changes occur in the gherkin files.
